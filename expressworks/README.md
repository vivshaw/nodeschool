# ExpressWorks

This was an excellent introduction to the world of Node's favorite little middleware-based web framework, Express. I found it enjoyable to work with, as Express is lightweight & minimal by default, and lets you build your own middleware stack on top of that if you need more. Kind of like a Sinatra/Rack dealio.

I also got to play with templating engines like Pug and CSS preprocessors like Stylus, which feel a bit like a Node version of HAML. I'm not 100% sold on these, but I'll keep messing around with them and perhaps they'll grow on me!

I do miss some of the higher-level features of Rails. I wonder if [feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) is targeted at devs like me?
