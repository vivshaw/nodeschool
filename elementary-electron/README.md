Turns out Javascript for the desktop is pretty neat! It's very interesting being able to call Node APIs from the front-end. I'm definitely interested in exploring this further. I am a little unclear though on how exactly a more complex Electron app would be structured. I suppose I'll have to comb through some codebases & figure it out!
