# learnyoucouchdb

After an awesome talk by @bradley-holt about offline-first development and CouchDB/PouchDB, I decided to give CouchDB a try. Good thing I did, because this is neat stuff! After getting through the exercises I decided to reimplement them all with [CouchDB Nano](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-nano), which is the code you see here. I'm impressed at how tidy & cozy it is to work with. I'm not normally a huge NoSQL fan, but this just may have converted me! I'm excited to try this out in conjunction with PouchDB, it seems like a really interesting stack.

On the count of 3... Relax!
